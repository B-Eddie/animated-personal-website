        Workflex is a web application I made as a prototype of a proposed
        project for DECA. It is a tool designed to solve the difficulty of
        flexible work times. Workflex features a calendar to view working hours,
        the feature login and signup for both employees and employers, a
        management dashboard for employers, and more.
